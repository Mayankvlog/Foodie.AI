# Recipe_recmmedation

The gave Python script, uses Streamlit for web application creation,


consolidating Pandas  for information control and NLTK for text handling.


It downloads important assets, peruses a CSV record of recipes, and 

introduces a Watchman Stemmer. The content characterizes a rundown of 

fixing choices. Because of space imperatives, the rundown incorporates 

different fixings like milk, cheddar, flavors, and liquor. 

These parts probably act as selectable things inside the application,

working with recipe investigation or examination. T

he content's usefulness past fixing taking care of stays indistinct minus any additional examination.
